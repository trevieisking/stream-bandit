# Stream Bandit TCG V2.4.45 Checklist — Pre-Generation Source-of-Truth Lock

## Mandatory pre-image gate
- [x] Refresh current PR #576 head before each image generation.
- [x] Read the current art-production ledger from that active branch.
- [x] Resolve the next card from repository source-of-truth, not memory.
- [x] Bind exact Card ID, Printing ID, Artwork ID, target path and visual brief before generation.
- [x] Check whether the canonical PNG already exists before generating.
- [x] Stop before generation if branch/ledger/path/sequence evidence disagrees.
- [x] Reject materially mismatched image candidates before upload.
- [x] Return to this source-of-truth gate before every subsequent card.

## Existing upload loop retained
- [x] Generate image only after the source preflight passes.
- [x] Create the canonical GitHub folder after a valid candidate exists.
- [x] Verify the folder before sharing the upload link.
- [x] Provide exact filename, final path, commit message and description.
- [x] Verify Trevor's commit and the real repository file.
- [x] Normalize accidental generated filenames using the same blob bytes.
- [x] Count artwork only after canonical-path verification.
- [x] Synchronize ledger/checklist/progress before advancing.
