## Safety standard

No page change should add schema, storage policy, payment provider, production Home replacement, service-role key, or destructive cleanup without explicit approval.

## Next safe plan target

Use the promoted registry truth to choose the next focused batch. Do not start destructive cleanup. Do not replace Home. Do not promote payments. Keep Web Builder, Social Media Group, Account Settings, Main App Movie Streaming and Admin/Registry as separate functions.
