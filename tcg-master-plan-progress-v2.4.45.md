# Stream Bandit TCG Progress V2.4.45 — Pre-Generation Source-of-Truth Lock

V2.4.45 removes the stale-memory failure mode from the Set One material artwork loop.

## Mandatory workflow

Before every image generation, the assistant must:

1. refresh PR #576 and record the current branch head;
2. read `assets/tcg/art-direction/tcg-art-production-ledger-v1.json` from that active branch;
3. resolve the next card from the locked batch order / remaining `artwork_status: missing` record;
4. bind the exact `card_id`, `printing_id`, `artwork_id`, `target_path` and visual brief;
5. verify the canonical PNG does not already exist;
6. only then generate the image.

After generation the existing locked loop continues:

`create GitHub path -> verify path -> give clickable link + filename + commit message + description -> Trevor uploads -> verify commit/canonical PNG -> synchronize truth -> repeat from source preflight`.

Conversation memory, model memory and prior response text are not sufficient authority for choosing the next card.

## Current verified material truth

Set One Standard/base PNG masters verified at canonical paths: **24/193**.
Astral verified: **24/24**.

Verified cards:
- Stardot
- Orbitail
- Cosmarch
- Moonbit
- Comettail
- Nebulynx
- Cometmanta
- Orbitortoise
- Prismowl
- Starwhale
- Celestyr — Dream Cartographer
- Basic Astral Essence
- Star Essence
- Orbit Essence
- Nova Essence
- Archivist Sol
- Cartographer Lyra
- Future Draw
- Gravity Shift
- Star Chart
- Celestial Observatory
- Dreamglass
- Orbit Ring
- Parallax Window

Astral Standard/base artwork is complete at **24/24**., but the workflow requires a fresh GitHub preflight again immediately before its image is generated.

## Rejected-candidate rule

A generated candidate that materially conflicts with the locked brief is rejected before upload and never counted. This is how the incorrect fox-like Cometmanta candidate was handled before the valid celestial manta was accepted.

## Safety / release boundary

No gameplay, runtime, database, Supabase, `main`, public Pages, live or production authority is changed by V2.4.45.

## First completed deck product-preview gate

When the first full starter-deck art package is complete, use the real approved assets to build a branch-only product preview before moving to the next deck presentation milestone.

- First preview deck: **Astral — Second Sky**.
- Trigger: Astral Standard/base art reaches **24/24** and the existing starter recipe remains valid.
- Preview surfaces: Shop Featured / Starter Decks plus a coordinated Battle Pass Season 1 preview.
- The shop preview must show the actual starter product identity, representative approved card art, and its matching **Second Sky Card Sleeve Set**, **Second Sky Battle Coin**, and **Second Sky Deck Box**.
- Official starter ownership continues to include the matching sleeves, battle coin and deck box once; unowned accessories remain individually obtainable from the in-game Shop per the accessory ledger.
- The preview is visual/product proof only until the canonical economy owner provides prices, purchase receipts, grants and ownership state. Do not fabricate prices, currencies, odds or grants.
- No preview may change gameplay, deck legality, randomness, card ownership or economy balances.

## Battle Pass Season 1 authority

**Set One (SB1) is the first Stream Bandit TCG Battle Pass season identity.**

- Season display identity: **Set One — Season 1**.
- Existing locked structure remains **100 tiers with a reward every tier** and three daily achievements.
- Set One cards, packs, cosmetics and deck accessories may be used as the Season 1 visual/reward pool only through the future progression/economy owner.
- This decision does **not** mean all 193 Set One cards are automatically granted by the pass.
- Exact free/premium track assignments, tier rewards, token costs, receipts, progression values and entitlement rules remain unassigned until the canonical Battle Pass/economy systems own them.
- After the Astral 24/24 deck-art gate, create a branch-only Battle Pass Season 1 visual preview beside the Second Sky Shop preview so the player-facing presentation can be reviewed with real assets.

Second Sky product-preview gate is now open because Astral artwork reached **24/24**; starter recipe revalidation and accessory/product-preview work remain separate next steps.
